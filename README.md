## Projects üíª
### **[Stock Analyzer App](https://github.com/jd-58/stock-analyzer)** - Python
A Python program that uses the Yahoo Finance API to download and display live stock data. Custom Tkinter was used to create a GUI, along with Matplotlib to create the graph.

### **[Weather Tracker Program](https://github.com/jd-58/weather-tracker)** - Assembly
A program built in x86 MASM Assembly that will track user-entered daily temperature readings, and output helpful statistics such as the minimum, maximum, and average temperature. It will also tell the user how many cold, cool, warm, and hot days there were!

### **[Blackjack Game](https://github.com/jd-58/blackjack)** - Python
A blackjack game made using Python and Pygame. Currently training an AI to play the game using Pytorch! The game is based on US Casino rules, including splitting (up to 3 hands per turn), doubling down, and late surrender.
